  },
  {
    "question": "How does HDR help with DPM illuminator heterogeneity?",
    "answer": "At short distances (e.g., 50 mm), contrast may be heterogeneous; HDR normalizes contrast allowing the use of Standard Contrast decoding settings."
  },
  {
    "question": "Can HDR improve decoding when codes in the FoV have different contrasts?",

  },
  {
    "question": "How does HDR affect exposure time and line speed?",
    "answer": "Enabling HDR allows reducing exposure time, which increases the maximum allowable line speed. The rule is Texp < X/LS (code resolution divided by line speed)."
  },
  {

  },
  {
    "question": "Why are higher gain settings often required for UV applications?",
